What is the SAP HANA deployment shell?

The SAP HANA deployment shell (Dshell) enables developers to develop and deploy with the tool of their choice, 
especially for the development of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 
The Dshell is available in the cloud, and GitHub triggers deployments using service hooks. Each time a developer 
pushes a change to the GitHub repository, the deployment shell automatically deploys the code to the configured 
instance of SAP HANA.

Developers must have:
- A GitHub user and repository
- The developer edition of SAP HANA (accessible in the cloud) 
  or
  SignUp for a Testversion on http://dshell.sap.com
